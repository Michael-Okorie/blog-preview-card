### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vanilla CSS](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/) - For styling

### What I learned

- Using **Flexbox** made aligning elements inside the card easy.
- I learned the importance of **semantic HTML** and how it can enhance accessibility.

```html
    <div class="card">
      <img src="./assets/images/illustration-article.svg" class="img" alt="Hero image">
      <button class="btn">Learning</button>
      <p class="pub">Published 21 Dec 2023</p>


```css
.avatar{
    float: left;
    width: 40px;
    height: 40px;
    margin-right: 12px;
    margin-top: -10px;
}

```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Deepen my knowledge of CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Implement animations for smoother transitions, especially on hover and focus states.
- Continue improving accessibility practices by incorporating ARIA roles.
